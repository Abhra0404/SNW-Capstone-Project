# Cura

A clean and responsive website designed as part of the **SNW Capstone Project**.  
This project focuses on structuring web content effectively and styling it using modern CSS practices — without using any JavaScript frameworks or backend.

## 🌐 Project Overview  

The website contains **five pages**, each crafted to demonstrate layout planning, UI clarity, and good visual balance:

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Home** | Main landing page introducing the website. |
| **About** | Brief overview of the context/purpose. |
| **Services** | Lists the services offered (or key features). |
| **Find Doctors** | Showcases the people involved (cards / grid layout). |
| **Contact** | Contains contact details and/or a contact form layout. |

All styling is done through a single CSS file to maintain consistency and simplicity.
